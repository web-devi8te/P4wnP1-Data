Hello.

As the title says. When using the P4wnP1 A.L.O.A 2022.03 image on a pi zero w from https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-arm, it doesn't let me deploy any USB configuration, instead reverting to last configuration everytime with a message saying "couldn't find a working UDC driver".

I plugged the MicroSD card into my PC and explored the boot partition. Inside it are two files, "cmdline.txt" and "config.txt". I added "modules-load=dwc2" after "rootwait" into the former, and added "dtoverlay=dwc2" under "[all]" into the latter.

After that I booted the pi. Got into the admin page, tried changing values and settings. Deployed. It worked.



Will this be fixed or is it intended behavior? If not intended, the fix that worked for me is written right there.

Edit: Fixed my mistake. It's "cmdline.txt", not "commandline.txt"
